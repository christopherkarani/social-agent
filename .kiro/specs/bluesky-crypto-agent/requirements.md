# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI agent that automatically creates and posts engaging crypto-related content to multiple social media platforms including Bluesky, Instagram, and Threads. The agent retrieves the latest cryptocurrency news using Perplexity API, analyzes and reasons about the content to create original viral posts, and publishes them on a scheduled basis (every 30 minutes) while running in a local Docker environment. The system adapts content for each platform's unique format requirements and audience expectations.
